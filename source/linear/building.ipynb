    "\n",
    "The purpose of the simplification was to get you used to interpreting the coefficients of a linear model. There's nothing that prevents us from adding more features to the equation but as we add more features, the line becomes a *hyperplane* and a lot of intuition goes out the window. It's even difficult to chart these.\n",

Unfortunately, the term \"variable\" is so common in discussions that instead of fighting a losing battle, we will use \"variable\" and \"feature\" synonymously.

    "The answer is probably not surprising, we should start with domain knowledge. The variables we have available are based on our discussion of the problem, meetings with domain experts, and qualitative modeling with Causal Loop Diagrams. We have wrestled to get the data (ETL) and wrestled with the data (EDA) and at this point we should have some intuitions about the variables, their relationships, and even possible transformations. This is a good starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, our first pass at a model will likely include all the variables we believe are relevant to the target variable, given our knowledge of the domain and the data that we were able to get (rather than the data we *wanted* to get). Whether they were explicit or implicit, we have our Causal Loop Diagrams to guide us. By using domain knowledge, we also satisfy one of the underlying assumptions of correct modeling, the assumption of *validity*. The assumption of validity assumes all the variables have a reason for being in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are techniques for the automatic selection of features, in general, selecting an optimal subset of features is NP-hard. It's easy to see why this is the case. If we have n variables and we want to select k features and build the best model we can, there are n choose k possibilities to pick from:\n",

That's a lot of combinations to try. And that doesn't include transformations or interaction terms. Increase the number of variables by 1 and you get even more possibilities.Domain knowledge at least gives us a foot in the door.\n",

    "2. legs, however, are not always the same length. 70% of people typically have one leg longer than the other. The average difference is generally less than 1.1 cm. Differences of 0-0.30 cm is considered a \"mild\" difference, 0.31-0.60, is considered moderate and greater than 0.61 is considered severe.\n",

Let's assume that heights are normally distributed with a coefficient of variation of about 10%. That gives us a range of heights. We'll pick an average leg length of 45% with 2.5% points as the standard deviation which will give us 95% of the data between 40-50%. We'll say that's the longer leg.\n",

You have to know what the purpose of your model is. And even if it is only estimation, that doesn't mean somewhere down the road, a regulatory body isn't going to ask you to explain what it does.

    "\n",
    "Although it's more difficult to introduce multicollinearity between binary features, it's not impossible. Consider the canonical binary feature (that's not entirely binary): gender. Suppose we have $gender$ in the linear model below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 gender + \\beta_2 income$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first observation is that when it comes to binary variables, we should name them whatever category is \"1\". So if it's 0 if female and 1 if male, we should just name the variable \"male\". This helps immeasurably with interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 male + \\beta_2 income$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this model, $\\beta_1$ becomes the differential effect being male. Where's the female effect? It's in $\\beta_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why can't we we have a variable, $female$ too and have $\\beta_0$ be zero?\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 male + \\beta_2 income + \\beta_3 female$\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if we think about it a second, this would mean that the data looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| id | male | female | income |\n",
    "|---|------|--------|--------|\n",
    "| 1 | 1 | 0 | 34000 |\n",
    "| 2 | 0 | 1 | 38000 |\n",
    "| 3 | 1 | 0 | 42000 |\n",

    "| 5 | 0 | 1 | 29000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "$male$ and $female$ are just the opposite of each other so there's no new information to be gained from including $female$ as a variable. And if male is 1 and female is 0, what is $\\beta_0$? This doesn't make sense. All of this seems obvious because we're used to \"natural\" binary variables like purchased, voted, etc. `gender` isn't necessarily binary, although we can often treat it as such. You would do well be aware if this makes a different for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if we have a new variable, politics, that has three values: {left, center, right}. Our first thought might be to code these as {1, 2, 3} but that doesn't make sense for linear models: left + center = right? Um, no. Instead we can do a \"one hot encoding\": left {0, 1}, center: {0, 1}, right: {0, 1}. Now, here's the question. If we want to include these variables in the linear model, \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 male + \\beta_2 income + \\beta_3 left + \\beta_4 center + \\beta_5 right$\n",
    "\n",
    "does it look like the above? No and for the same reason that we didn't include both male and female in the model. Here's the rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every non-binary variable must be converted to a one hot encoding using the label as the feature name if possible. This will create $m$ new binary variables if the original variable has $m$ labels or outcomes. However, you can only include $m-1$ of these new features in your linear model. The missing variable gets pushed into the interpretation of $\\beta_0$, the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works. We're going to take out \"left\":\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 male + \\beta_2 income + \\beta_3 center + \\beta_4 right$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the male effect is $\\beta_1$, the center effect is $\\beta_3$, and the right effect is $\\beta_4$. Where is the female effect? $\\beta_0$. Where is the left effect? $\\beta_0$. In fact, $\\beta_0$ is now \"left females\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Where is the effect for right females? $\\beta_0 + \\beta_4$. Left males? $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes a strong assumption that politics and gender are independent (no pun intended) and this may not be the case. We may want to create interaction terms. However,\n",
    "\n",
    "> the more specific the terms in your model, the more data you need to estimate it\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have a lot of Pagan, right, low income males in your data set...you're not going to get good estimates of the coefficients. Binary variables are always partitioning your data set into subpopulations. As we have seen, their presence in a model doesn't have the same effect on the model as a numeric feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows that of the $m$ one hot encodings, which one do we push into $\\beta_0$? It is often said that it doesn't matter but I disagree. You need to take the relative frequency of the subpopulations into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider what happens if you drop the binary variable with the fewest observations. With fewer observations, $\\beta_0$ will have a higher variance than the incremental effect $\\beta_1$ (for example). This might not be good if we need a solid estimate of the base effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we're interested *only* in the differential effect (how much does it change in the presence of the category), dropping the encoding out of $m$ with the fewest observations might be satisfactory. Conversely, if we *do* want good base rate estimates, then we want to drop the encoding out of $m$ with the most observations. Another option is to combine categories in meaningful ways to increase the number of observations they cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what, at least for primary effects, one of the one hot encodings for each such transformed categorical variable needs to be left out. The value will be pushed into the interpretation of $\\beta_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now modify our steps for building linear models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with all features as suggested by domain knowledge, but...\n",
    "2. Analyze features for correlations and, of those groups, consider picking the best variable, an average of the variables, or some other transformation (sum, min, max, etc).\n",
    "3. Transform all categorical variables into one hot encodings but leave one encoding out of the model for each variable. The intercept $\\beta_0$ represent all the outcomes that are excluded explicitly. Which one you leave out might depend on the number of observations for each and what you want to do with the model.\n",

    "## Guidelines for Evaluating Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "The general guidelines for evaluating coefficients when working with posterior distributions and credible intervals instead of confidence intervals changes a little bit. When we have a confidence interval of (-0.23, 5.97) we note that the coefficient *might* be zero and we just don't know. However, if we have a credible interval with the same bounds and the posterior distribution, we might say there's an 83% probability that the coefficient is positive (or a 17% probability that it's negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Case | Sign | Credible Interval | Action |\n",
    "|------|------------|--------------------|------------|\n",
    "| 1    | expected | does not include 0 | Keep  |\n",
    "| 2    | expected | does include 0 | Keep |\n",
    "| 3    | unexpected | does not include 0 | Re-examine |\n",
    "| 4    | unexpected | does include 0 | Remove |\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, for this interpretation, we're treating a 95% *credible* interval that contains 0 as some evidence that the coefficient might be (however slim) the oppose sign. Alternatively, we might interpret ranges of the posterior distribution as [0, 33%) \"weak\" evidence, [33, 66%), \"mixed\" evidence, and [66%, 100%] \"strong\" evidence for a particular sign. *Don't get hung up on it*. Use your judgment and experience. If you aren't sure, go with the interval  interpretation until you get experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why are these rules of thumb the way they are and why they might be reasonable?\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, we can think of \"the expected sign\" as an informal prior probability of at least the *direction* of influence by the variable, positive or negative. In actual Bayesian modeling it is possible to include this information as an actual prior probability on $\\beta_i$ but we're doing this informally here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the first case, say we have an informal prior of \"positive\", an actual positive coefficient and the confidence interval that does not include zero. This implies that the confidence interval includes only positive values. Since our informal prior was only about the *sign*, we should keep the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, say we have an informal prior of \"positive\", an actual positive coefficient but the confidence interval includes 0. Remember that the confidence interval is really a section of the posterior probability of the $\\beta_i$ in question. If the coefficient is positive and the confidence interval is symmetric, then there must be a greater than 50% probability that the coefficient is positive. This is why we keep it. But since we have the posterior probability, we might be able to find out if the probability really *is* 50/50 and adjust accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third case, say we have an informal prior of \"positive\", an actual negative coefficient and a confidence interval that does not include zero. This means that we are pretty confident that, given the data, the probability of the value being negative is 95%. This means that we need to re-evaluate our beliefs about the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the variable is incumbency. In the US, this is often positively correlated with re-election but in India, incumbency is negatively correlated. The unexpected sign might also mean that some unknown variable is missing. Yes, this can happen, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fourth case, say we have an informal prior of \"positive\", an actual negative coefficient and a confidence interval that includes zero. Because it includes zero and the coefficient is negative, there is a greater than 50% chance the coefficient is actually negative but the evidence is not overwhelming. We could also consider this under the third case if the confidence interval is really skewed towards negative when we expected positive. That is, we can bring in our ideas of \"weak\", \"mixed\" and \"strong\" evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the reasoning works if we make all the necessary substitutions starting with \"say we have an informal prior of 'negative'\". We can also think of this in terms of ROPE (region of practical significance), we think of the base line as being zero or not and things \"near zero\" might be practically zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method of evaluation means thinking ahead of time (remember *validity*?) about the expected sign of the coefficients. This emerges implicitly from our domain knowledge or explicitly through Causal Loop Diagrams."

    "## Interpreting Coefficients (Again)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one last thing we haven't addressed about coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already talked about the predictive and the causal interpretations of coefficients. The predictive interpretation is not quite as easy to describe. Basically, linear models are predicting means of some kind. If we look at a set of specific values for a set of features then we're trying to predict the mean of the target variable for that set of feature values. Using child_iq again, if we think of mothers with IQs of 100, then we're predicting the mean IQ of their children. And the $beta_i$ of mom_iq, predicts the change in the mean when we look at mothers with IQs of 101.\n",
    "\n",
    "The causal interpretation is closer to the \"slope\" idea of a coefficient. If mother's IQ increases by 1 point, then we expect the child's IQ to change by $\\beta_i$, on average. This is also called the *counterfactual* interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a question that is often asked about linear models that we haven't yet addressed. When you have a model of 10 features, which coefficient, $\\beta_i$, is more important? or strongest? And it turns out that this is not an easy question to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason is that the $\\beta_i$ coefficients have *two* jobs to do. First, they measure the *effect*. But, second, they *scale* one metric into another. While mom_iq points and child_iq points are in the same units, mom_age and child_iq are not. They are very nearly not even of the same magnitudes and consider a coefficient that must convert from bedrooms to prices in hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, a large coefficient may be both converting a small number into a larger number's domain and representing a small effect while a smaller coefficient may be converting numbers into the same ranges but represents a (relatively) large effect. It is because of this that it's generally difficult to talk about which coefficients are more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk about ways of working around this when we talk about transformations."
